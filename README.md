# Netsuite Support Helper
Netsuite is a customer management suite of tools developed by Oracle.
One of its weaknesses is the inability to manage queues of multiple support tickets. This chrome extension is designed to scrape information from Netsuite and present it in a more meaningful fashion.

# Caveats
